# Barrierts

A Minecraft Java server written in TypeScript!

Its just a small project that I work in my free time.

# SetUp

### Requirements

-   node 10.13.0 or higher

### Running

First you want to install all the dev packages.

```bash
npm i
```

Then you want to compile the code.

```bash
npm run build
```

Once all that is done you can start the server!

```bash
npm start
```

# Development

You can work on this project and submit pull request.

I don't want to use any Dependencies only devDependencies.

You can use `npm run dev` to run barrierts in nodemon.
