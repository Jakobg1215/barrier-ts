# Barrierts

A Minecraft Java server written in TypeScript!

Its just a small project that I work in my free time.

# Features

Right we still need to work on the foundations of the software

# SetUp

## Requirements

-   You must have node installed on your computer. (version 17.7.0 or higher)
-   You must have npm installed on your computer. (version 8.5.0 or higher)

## Running

First you want to install all the dev packages.

```bash
npm i
```

Then you want to compile the code.

```bash
npm run build
```

Once all that is done you can start the server!

```bash
npm start
```
