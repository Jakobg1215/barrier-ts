# Barrierts
A Minecraft Java server written in TypeScript!

Its just a small project that I work in my free time.

### Running
First you want to install all the dev packages.
```bash
npm i
```
Then you want to compile the code.
```bash
npm run build
```
Once all that is done you can start the server!
```bash
npm start
```
